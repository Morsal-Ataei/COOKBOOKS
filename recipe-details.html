  <p><strong>Prepare Dough:</strong></p>
  <p>In a large bowl, mix flour and salt together. Slowly add oil and water and mix until a cohesive ball is formed. <br>
     If the dough seems dry, add additional water one tablespoon at a time.
     Knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic, <br> about 7 to 10 minutes.
     Transfer to a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and set aside for one hour.</p>

  <p><strong>Prepare Filling:</strong></p>  
  <p>Combine mashed potatoes, cilantro, spring onions, oil, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and salt and mix well. <br>
    Try to mash the filling so that it is as smooth as possible. Set aside.</p> <hr>


  <p><strong>Assemble and Cook:</strong></p> 

  <ol> 
  <li>Divide the dough and filling into 6 to 8 portions.</li> 
  <li>Roll each ball of dough on a lightly floured surface into a large and thin circle, 8 to 10-inches in diameter.</li> <br>
